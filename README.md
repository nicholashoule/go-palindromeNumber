# go-palindromeNumber

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindromic number. (Bonus: Try not to use strings)

A [palindromic number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindromic_number) (also known as a numeral palindrome or a numeric palindrome) is a number (such as 16461) that remains the same when its digits are reversed. In other words, it has reflectional symmetry across a vertical axis. 

- Example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 and 122 are not
- Negative numbers are not palindromic (-123 != 123-)
- Zero (0) in any base and is also palindromic by definition

### Usage

```
go run .
```
